\section{The first section}

One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself
transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back,
and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed
and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover
it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin
compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked.
"What's happened to me?" he thought. 


\section{Another section} It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human room
although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls. A
collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table - Samsa was a
travelling salesman - and above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut
out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame. It showed a
lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur
muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer. Gregor then
turned to look out the window at the dull weather.

As many sections as you need... 

This is an example of a citation \parencite{raghunathan-etal-2010-multi}. And
this is in-text citation,  \cite{raghunathan-etal-2010-multi}, which is
different. You may use this website for more:
